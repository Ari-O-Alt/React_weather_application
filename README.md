### IMPORTANT
In order for the application to work, you need to have a valid API key from OpenWeatherMap. Steps to follow:
 - register to Open Wather and generate a key for your own usage.
 - create a `config.js` file and store your keys inside it (see `src/App.jsx`, line 3, where I am importing the "api" object holding my base URL and my access key). You can use the base URL and the access key directly in the `App.jsx` file but if you're planning on uploading your code to Github I suggest you hide them in a separate file which you need to add to .gitignore.
 - after getting your own API key, insert it in the code and you should be good to go.
